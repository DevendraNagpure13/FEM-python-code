# FEM-python-code
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Finite Element Method (FEM), a powerful technique for numerically solving differential equations that are often encountered in engineering, physics, and other scientific domains. The core of this project is to provide a simple, yet efficient, Python codebase for FEM approximation, making it accessible for educational purposes, research, and practical applications.
